I trust this mail finds you well. I am writing to formally request a transfer from the Records Management Unit, Kitui TSO, to the Corporate Data Office at Times Tower.

Having commenced my journey with a three-month attachment, I was recommended and retained for a one-year internship within the Records Management Unit. Over this period, I have actively contributed to the success of the unit. My achievements include revamping of the Kitui TSO registry and automation of its operations, resulting in a significant enhancement of day-to-day activities' such as documents retrieval and tracking.

While I appreciate the valuable experience gained in Records Management, my true passion lies in data science and artificial intelligence. I am confident that my proficiency in Python, SQL, and JavaScript, coupled with my background in statistics acquired through my Bachelor of Science degree in statistics, would make a substantial contribution to the Corporate Data Office.

During the extended period, as indicated in the recent extension letter for six months post-internship, I aim to further hone my skills and knowledge in data science. I am eager to leverage this time to immerse myself in the challenges and opportunities presented by the Corporate Data Office at Times Tower.

I am actively pursuing additional learning opportunities to expand my expertise in data science, and I am confident that I can swiftly adapt to the specific tools and technologies used within the department, contributing effectively to its success.

Recognizing the potential need to fill the vacancy within the Records Management Unit promptly, I am committed to facilitating a smooth transition for my successor. I am willing to assist in any way possible to ensure a seamless handover of responsibilities.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this opportunity further with you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

Issa Katana.
